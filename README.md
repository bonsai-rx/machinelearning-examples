# Bonsai.ML - Examples

The Bonsai.ML project is a collection of packages built to target the Bonsai-Rx ecosystem, providing reactive infrastructure for machine learning operations.

In the [Bonsai.ML - Examples](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/machinelearning-examples) repo, we provide example workflows, datasets, and demos for how to get started using the suite of Bonsai.ML packages that are currently available. We provide documentation for each example to illustrate how Bonsai.ML can be incorporated into Bonsai workflows.

For each Bonsai.ML package, check out the Getting Started page to learn more about how to run the example workflows yourself.
